module code program
support list, queue, stack, tree, command arguments parse, inifile parse interfaces

this idea came mainly from the author of corenova Peter K. Lee <saint@corenova.com> , 
and some code copied from his corenova. but the corenova is complex and difficult 
to understand, and the programming of corenova is diffrent from normal programming, 
so i simply create this, which support some normal interfaces. i hope it will be 
useful.

version 0.0.1    first version

useage
